# MNIST-Digit-Classification
The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark in machine learning for image classification. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels), each labeled from 0 to 9.  This project trains an MLP model on the dataset and allows users to draw digits on a virtual canvas and get real-time predictions using a Gradio interface.
